        "# Bitemporal Change Detection using Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR)\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook explores a fundamental remote sensing technique: **Change Detection**. The goal is to identify and map differences in landscape conditions by comparing satellite images acquired at different points in time.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Introduction to Change Detection\n",
        "\n",
        "Change detection is crucial for monitoring environmental dynamics, managing natural resources, and assessing the impact of events. Examples include:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Tracking deforestation or reforestation.\n",
        "*   Mapping the extent and severity of wildfires or volcanic eruptions.\n",
        "*   Monitoring urban expansion.\n",
        "*   Observing changes in water bodies or coastlines.\n",
        "*   Assessing agricultural practices like harvesting.\n",
        "\n",
        "The basic premise underlying many change detection methods is that significant changes on the landscape will result in measurable differences in the spectral reflectance values captured by satellite sensors between two dates.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Challenges in Change Detection\n",
        "\n",
        "While the concept is straightforward, accurately detecting *meaningful* change requires distinguishing it from various sources of \"noise\" or non-target variations in the spectral signal. These can include:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Seasonal variations & Phenology:** Changes in vegetation greenness due to normal seasonal cycles.\n",
        "*   **Atmospheric Effects:** Differences in haze, aerosols, or water vapor between dates.\n",
        "*   **Illumination Differences:** Variations in sun angle and topography.\n",
        "*   **Sensor Differences:** Variations between different satellite sensors or even calibration changes over time.\n",
        "*   **Image Misregistration:** Imperfect alignment of pixels between images.\n",
        "*   **Clouds and Shadows:** Obscuring the land surface and changing illumination.\n",
        "\n",
        "Simple two-date differencing methods work best for detecting abrupt, relatively long-lived changes over large areas, where the change signal is strong compared to the noise.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Methodology: Two-Date NBR Differencing\n",
        "\n",
        "This exercise focuses on a common and effective method for detecting changes, particularly those related to vegetation health, stress, or removal (like fire impacts): **differencing the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR)** between a pre-event and a post-event image.\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR):**\n",
        "NBR is a spectral index calculated from the Near-Infrared (NIR) and Shortwave Infrared (SWIR) bands. For Landsat 8, we typically use SWIR2 (Band 7).\n",
        "$$\n",
        "NBR = \\frac{(NIR - SWIR2)}{(NIR + SWIR2)}\n",
        "$$\n",
        "Rationale: Healthy vegetation reflects strongly in the NIR and absorbs in the SWIR, leading to high NBR values. Burned areas, bare soil, or stressed/dry vegetation have lower NIR and higher SWIR reflectance, resulting in lower NBR values. Values range from -1 to +1.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Difference NBR (dNBR or ΔNBR):**\n",
        "    *   The core of the change analysis is calculating the difference between NBR maps from two dates.\n",
        "    *   Formula:\n",
        "$$ dNBR = NBR_{post} - NBR_{pre} $$\n",
        "    *   Interpretation:\n",
        "        *   **Negative dNBR values:** Indicate a decrease in NBR, strongly suggesting vegetation loss or stress (e.g., fire damage, logging). Larger negative values typically correspond to more severe damage.\n",
        "        *   **Values near zero:** Indicate little or no significant change in NBR between the two dates (stable areas).\n",
        "        *   **Positive dNBR values:** Indicate an increase in NBR, suggesting vegetation regrowth or increased greenness.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Thresholding:**\n",
        "    *   To create a thematic map, the continuous dNBR values are often classified into discrete categories (e.g., High Severity Loss, Low Severity Loss, Stable, Regrowth) by applying specific **thresholds**. Selecting appropriate thresholds is crucial and often requires calibration or knowledge of the specific event and region.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Workflow Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook will guide you through the following steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Image Preparation:** Load Landsat 8 Surface Reflectance data, define pre- and post-event time periods, filter images based on location and cloud cover, select the best image for each period, and apply necessary scaling/renaming.\n",
        "2.  **Visualization:** Create and examine false-color composites of the pre- and post-event images to visually identify potential changes.\n",
        "3.  **NBR Calculation:** Compute the NBR index for both the pre- and post-event images.\n",
        "4.  **dNBR Calculation:** Calculate the difference image (dNBR) by subtracting the pre-event NBR from the post-event NBR.\n",
        "5.  **Change Classification:** Apply thresholds to the dNBR image to create a classified map showing areas of loss, stability, and gain.\n",
        "6.  **Map Display:** Visualize the dNBR and classified change maps using appropriate color palettes.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Dataset\n",
        "\n",
        "We will use **Landsat 8 Collection 2, Level 2 Surface Reflectance** data (`LANDSAT/LC08/C02/T1_L2`). Using Surface Reflectance (SR) is important as it corrects for atmospheric effects, providing more comparable reflectance values between different dates.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Learning Objectives\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Create and interpret false-color composites for visual assessment.\n",
        "*   Calculate the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) index.\n",
        "*   Create a difference image (dNBR) between two time periods.\n",
        "*   Produce a classified change map using thresholding on the dNBR image.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key GEE Concepts\n",
        "\n",
        "*   `ee.ImageCollection`, `.filterDate()`, `.filterBounds()`, `.sort()`, `.first()`\n",
        "*   `.select()` with band renaming\n",
        "*   Applying scaling factors to SR data\n",
        "*   `.normalizedDifference()` for index calculation\n",
        "*   `.subtract()` for image differencing\n",
