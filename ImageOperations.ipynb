        "# Exploring Satellite Image Operations and Spectral Indices with GEE\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook delves into fundamental image processing techniques using Google Earth Engine (GEE) and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. We will explore how to transform raw satellite reflectance data into meaningful information by calculating spectral indices, applying thresholds, and classifying pixels based on their spectral properties.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "Satellite images provide a wealth of information about the Earth's surface, but raw reflectance values across different spectral bands often need further processing to extract specific features or characteristics. Spectral indices, which are mathematical combinations of different bands, are powerful tools designed to enhance specific phenomena like vegetation health, water content, or soil/mineral composition while minimizing noise and illumination effects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Thresholding and classification techniques allow us to convert these continuous index values or raw reflectance data into discrete categories or thematic maps, enabling quantitative analysis and visualization of land cover types and conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Topics Covered\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we will cover:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Loading and Visualizing Sentinel-2 Data:** Accessing and displaying cloud-filtered Surface Reflectance imagery.\n",
        "2.  **Calculating Common Spectral Indices:**\n",
        "    *   **NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index):** Quantifying vegetation greenness and health.\n",
        "    *   **NDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index):** Highlighting water bodies and vegetation moisture content.\n",
        "3.  **Thresholding and Masking:** Creating binary maps (e.g., vegetation vs. non-vegetation) by applying thresholds to index values.\n",
        "4.  **Basic Statistics:** Calculating pixel counts and percentages for thresholded areas within a Region of Interest (ROI).\n",
        "5.  **Multi-Class Mapping with `.where()`:** Classifying pixels into multiple categories based on index ranges.\n",
        "6.  **Domain-Specific Indices (Geology Example):**\n",
        "    *   **CMR (Clay Minerals Ratio):** Identifying potential clay mineral presence.\n",
        "    *   **IOR (Iron Oxide Ratio):** Highlighting areas potentially rich in iron oxides.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Workflow Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Setup:** Initialize GEE and configure the environment.\n",
        "2.  **Data Acquisition:** Load and preprocess a Sentinel-2 SR image for a chosen location and time.\n",
        "3.  **Index Calculation:** Compute various spectral indices (NDVI, NDWI, CMR, IOR).\n",
        "4.  **Analysis & Classification:** Apply thresholds and use `.where()` for classification. Calculate basic statistics.\n",
        "5.  **Visualization:** Display the original image, calculated indices, and classified maps using Folium for interactive comparison.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Dataset\n",
        "\n",
        "We will primarily use **Sentinel-2 Surface Reflectance (SR)** data provided by the Copernicus program (`COPERNICUS/S2_SR_HARMONIZED`). This dataset provides atmospherically corrected imagery at 10-20m resolution across multiple spectral bands, suitable for a wide range of land cover analyses.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Learning Objectives\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Load, preprocess (scale), and visualize Sentinel-2 imagery.\n",
        "*   Understand the formulas and rationale behind NDVI, NDWI, CMR, and IOR.\n",
        "*   Calculate spectral indices using GEE's built-in functions (`.normalizedDifference`, band math).\n",
        "*   Apply thresholds (`.gt`, `.lte`) to create binary masks.\n",
        "*   Use `.reduceRegion()` with `ee.Reducer.sum()` and `ee.Reducer.count()` for basic statistics.\n",
        "*   Visualize and compare different image processing results on an interactive map."
