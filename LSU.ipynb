        "# Linear Spectral Unmixing (LSU)\n",
        "\n",
        "Linear Spectral Unmixing is a technique used to address the common challenge in remote sensing known as the \"mixed pixel\" problem. Pixels in satellite images often cover areas on the ground containing multiple distinct surface materials (e.g., a mix of grass, soil, and pavement). LSU aims to **estimate the fractional abundance** (or proportion) of predefined fundamental surface materials, called **endmembers**, within each pixel.\n",
        "\n",
        "## The Linear Mixing Model\n",
        "\n",
        "The core assumption behind *linear* unmixing is that the spectrum measured by the sensor for a mixed pixel is a **linear combination** of the \"pure\" spectra of the endmembers present within that pixel, weighted by their respective fractional abundances.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mathematically, for a given pixel, its reflectance $p_{\\lambda}$ in a specific spectral band $\\lambda$ is modeled as the sum of the endmember reflectances $m_{i, \\lambda}$ weighted by their fractions $f_i$, plus some error $\\epsilon_{\\lambda}$:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$ p_{\\lambda} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (f_i \\cdot m_{i, \\lambda}) + \\epsilon_{\\lambda} $$\n",
        "\n",
        "Where:\n",
        "*   $p_{\\lambda}$: The reflectance measured for the pixel in band $\\lambda$.\n",
        "*   $N$: The number of endmembers.\n",
        "*   $f_i$: The fractional abundance (proportion) of the *i*-th endmember within the pixel (the value we want to estimate).\n",
        "*   $m_{i, \\lambda}$: The reflectance of the *i*-th \"pure\" endmember material in band $\\lambda$.\n",
        "*   $\\epsilon_{\\lambda}$: The residual error in band $\\lambda$, accounting for model inaccuracies and noise.\n",
        "\n",
        "Considering all spectral bands simultaneously, this can be expressed more compactly using vector/matrix notation:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$ \\mathbf{p} = \\mathbf{M} \\mathbf{f} + \\mathbf{e} $$\n",
        "\n",
        "Where:\n",
        "*   $\\mathbf{p}$: The pixel spectrum vector (containing $p_{\\lambda}$ for all bands).\n",
        "*   $\\mathbf{M}$: The matrix whose columns are the endmember spectra vectors ($\\mathbf{m}_i$).\n",
        "*   $\\mathbf{f}$: The vector of fractional abundances ($f_i$) for all endmembers.\n",
        "*   $\\mathbf{e}$: The error vector (containing $\\epsilon_{\\lambda}$ for all bands).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Endmembers: The Key Ingredient\n",
        "\n",
        "The success of LSU heavily depends on identifying appropriate **endmembers**. These represent the pure, fundamental materials assumed to mix within the scene. Common endmembers might include:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Green Vegetation\n",
        "*   Non-Photosynthetic Vegetation (Dry Grass, Wood)\n",
        "*   Soil (various types)\n",
        "*   Water (clear, turbid)\n",
        "*   Impervious Surfaces (concrete, asphalt, roofing)\n",
        "*   Shade/Shadow (often included as a \"photometric\" endmember)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Defining Endmember Spectra:** This is often the most challenging step. Endmember spectra can be obtained from:\n",
        "1.  **Spectral Libraries:** Standardized lab or field measurements (e.g., USGS Spectral Library, ECOSTRESS). Requires careful matching to image conditions and sensor bands.\n",
        "2.  **Image-Based Methods:** Identifying the \"purest\" pixels within the image itself. This can be done manually by selecting pixels visually representing pure materials, or using automated techniques like the Pixel Purity Index (PPI) often combined with N-FINDR algorithm (more advanced).\n",
        "\n",
        "## The `unmix()` Function in GEE\n",
        "\n",
        "Google Earth Engine provides a convenient function, `image.unmix()`, that performs constrained linear spectral unmixing. You provide:\n",
        "1.  The input image (typically Surface Reflectance).\n",
        "2.  A list containing the endmember spectra (where each endmember's spectrum is itself a list of reflectance values corresponding to the input image bands).\n",
        "\n",
        "The `unmix()` function solves the linear mixing equation for the fractional abundances ($\\mathbf{f}$) for each pixel. Importantly, it applies constraints:\n",
        "*   **Sum-to-One Constraint:** The sum of the estimated fractions for a pixel should ideally equal 1 (i.e., $\\sum_{i=1}^{N} f_i = 1$).\n",
        "*   **Non-Negativity Constraint:** Fractional abundances cannot be negative (i.e., $f_i \\ge 0$ for all $i$).\n",
        "\n",
        "The output is a multi-band image where each band represents the estimated fractional abundance ($f_i$) of the corresponding endmember provided in the input list.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Connection to Matrix Algebra\n",
        "\n",
        "Although the `unmix()` function abstracts the details, solving the equation $\\mathbf{p} = \\mathbf{M} \\mathbf{f}$ for $\\mathbf{f}$ fundamentally involves matrix algebra. In an unconstrained least-squares sense, it requires calculating the **pseudo-inverse** ($\\mathbf{M}^{+}$) of the endmember matrix $\\mathbf{M}$ and multiplying it by the pixel spectrum $\\mathbf{p}$:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$ \\mathbf{f} \\approx \\mathbf{M}^{+} \\mathbf{p} $$\n",
        "\n",
        "The constraints (sum-to-one, non-negative) add complexity, often requiring iterative optimization or specific algorithms like Fully Constrained Least Squares (FCLS), which are handled internally by `image.unmix()`.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Use Cases\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Urban Mapping:** Estimating the fraction of impervious surfaces vs. vegetation cover.\n",
        "*   **Vegetation Monitoring:** Quantifying vegetation cover changes, separating green from dry vegetation.\n",
        "*   **Water Body Analysis:** Estimating water fractions, potentially sediment load if suitable endmembers are used.\n",
        "*   **Burn Severity Mapping:** Unmixing char, green vegetation, and soil components.\n",
        "*   **Agriculture:** Assessing crop residue cover."
