        "\n",
        "## Introduction to Vegetation Indices in Remote Sensing\n",
        "\n",
        "The Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) represents a significant advancement in remote sensing technology for vegetation monitoring. Developed to overcome limitations of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), EVI offers improved sensitivity in high biomass regions and greater robustness against atmospheric and soil background effects.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Comparative Advantages of EVI over NDVI\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Reduced Saturation in Dense Vegetation:** While NDVI tends to saturate in areas with high leaf area index, EVI maintains sensitivity in dense forest canopies, allowing for more accurate biomass estimation—a critical parameter in environmental modeling.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Atmospheric Resistance:** EVI incorporates the blue band to correct for atmospheric aerosol scattering, reducing the influence of atmospheric conditions on vegetation measurements.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Soil Background Adjustment:** The algorithm includes coefficients that minimize soil brightness influences, producing more reliable results in areas with varying soil exposure.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Mathematical Formulation\n",
        "\n",
        "The EVI is calculated using the following equation:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\\text{EVI} = G \\times \\frac{\\text{NIR} - \\text{Red}}{\\text{NIR} + C_1 \\times \\text{Red} - C_2 \\times \\text{Blue} + L}\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "Where:\n",
        "- NIR = Near-infrared reflectance\n",
        "- Red = Red band reflectance\n",
        "- Blue = Blue band reflectance\n",
        "- L = Canopy background adjustment factor (typically 1)\n",
        "- C₁, C₂ = Coefficients for atmospheric correction (typically 6 and 7.5, respectively)\n",
        "- G = Gain factor (typically 2.5)\n",

        "## Implementation with Sentinel-2 Data\n",

        "- B8 (842 nm) = NIR\n",

        "- B2 (490 nm) = Blue\n",

        "$$\n",
        "\\text{EVI} = 2.5 \\times \\frac{B_{8, \\text{scaled}} - B_{4, \\text{scaled}}}{B_{8, \\text{scaled}} + 6 \\times B_{4, \\text{scaled}} - 7.5 \\times B_{2, \\text{scaled}} + 1}\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "## Critical Preprocessing: Reflectance Scaling\n",
        "\n",
        "When working with Sentinel-2 surface reflectance products (e.g., 'COPERNICUS/S2_SR_HARMONIZED'), values are typically scaled by a factor of 10,000. Proper normalization is essential before applying the EVI algorithm:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "B8_scaled = B8_original / 10000\n",

        "## What is BAI and Why is it Important? 🔎\n",
        "\n",
        "Imagine a wildfire has just swept through an area. How can we quickly see from space exactly where the fire burned? That's where the **Burned Area Index (BAI)** comes in handy!\n",
        "\n",
        "The BAI was developed by scientists (Chuvieco et al., 2002, based on ideas from Martín, 1998) to help us pinpoint burned regions using satellite images. It's like a special pair of glasses that makes burned areas stand out.\n",
        "\n",
        "**How does it work?** Satellites see different \"colors\" or bands of light. After a fire:\n",
        "*   **🌿 Healthy Plants:** Reflect a lot of Near-Infrared (NIR) light (invisible to us) and absorb most Red light (for photosynthesis).\n",
        "*   **⚫️ Burned Areas:** Vegetation is gone or charred. This char and ash reflect less NIR light and a bit more Red light compared to healthy plants.\n",
        "\n",
        "BAI looks at these differences. It calculates how \"spectrally close\" each tiny spot (pixel) in the image is to a \"signature\" of burnt material (like charcoal and ash) in the Red and NIR light bands.\n",
        "*   **High BAI values:** Mean the pixel looks very much like burnt material. 🔥\n",
        "*   **Low BAI values:** Mean the pixel looks more like unburnt plants or soil. 🌱\n",
        "\n",
        "## The Magic Formula for BAI 🧙‍♂️\n",
        "\n",
        "The mathematical recipe for the Burned Area Index (BAI) is:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$ \\text{BAI} = \\frac{1}{(0.1 - \\text{Red}_{\\text{scaled}})^2 + (0.06 - \\text{NIR}_{\\text{scaled}})^2} $$\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's break this down:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **$\\text{Red}_{\\text{scaled}}$**: This is the surface reflectance value (how much light is bouncing off) in the **Red** part of the light spectrum. We need this value to be a decimal between 0 and 1 (e.g., 0.2). ❤️\n",
        "*   **$\\text{NIR}_{\\text{scaled}}$**: This is the surface reflectance value in the **Near-Infrared** (NIR) part of the light spectrum. Again, this should be a decimal between 0 and 1 (e.g., 0.05). ✨\n",
        "*   **$0.1$**: This is a constant reference value for Red light. It represents a typical Red reflectance for burned material.\n",
        "*   **$0.06$**: This is a constant reference value for NIR light. It represents a typical NIR reflectance for burned material.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Think of it like this:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The bottom part of the fraction (the denominator) is calculating something like the *distance* between:\n",
        "1.  The Red and NIR values of a pixel in our satellite image.\n",
        "2.  The \"ideal\" Red (0.1) and NIR (0.06) values for something that's perfectly burned.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   If a pixel is **very burned**, its Red and NIR values will be very close to 0.1 and 0.06. This makes the denominator (the \"distance\") very small.\n",
        "*   When you divide 1 by a very small number, you get a **LARGE BAI value**.\n",
        "*   If a pixel is **not burned**, its Red and NIR values will be further away from 0.1 and 0.06. This makes the denominator larger.\n",
        "*   When you divide 1 by a larger number, you get a **smaller BAI value**.\n",
        "\n",
        "**🚦 CRUCIAL NOTE ON SCALING!**\n",
        "\n",
        "Just like with EVI, the satellite data (especially from Landsat Collection 2 Surface Reflectance) often comes with its reflectance values multiplied by a big number (e.g., `0.0000275` and then an offset of `-0.2` is applied to get numbers like 5000 instead of 0.5).\n",
        "\n",
        "The BAI formula **NEEDS** the `Red` and `NIR` values to be true surface reflectance, typically scaled between 0 and 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "So, **BEFORE** you plug them into the BAI formula, you **MUST** apply the correct scaling factors provided by the satellite data provider (like USGS for Landsat). For Landsat 8/9 Collection 2 Level 2 data, this typically involves:\n",
        "1.  Multiplying the original band value (e.g., `SR_B4`) by `0.0000275`.\n",
        "2.  Adding `-0.2` to the result.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you skip this scaling, your BAI values will be completely wrong! 😬\n",
        "\n",
        "**What do BAI values mean?**\n",
        "*   **Higher BAI values:** Stronger indication of burned area. These areas will often appear bright in a BAI image.\n",
        "*   **Lower BAI values:** Indicate unburned vegetation, soil, water, or clouds.\n",
        "\n",
        "BAI is a powerful tool for quickly mapping the extent of fire damage and for studying how landscapes recover over time."
